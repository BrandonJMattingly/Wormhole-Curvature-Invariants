# Curvature-Invariants ver 1.0 on 11/17/20

Notebook(s) Description:
____________________
These notebooks calculate the curvature invariants for various wormholes. 
They take a spacetime metric as an input and output the curvature invariant functions. Then, they may plot the functions as desired.

GENERAL USAGE NOTES:
____________________
- Run individual notebooks on Wolfram Mathematica.
- Be sure to run the Clear[...] line before running.
- You may ignore the "Do you want to automatically evaaluate all the inialization cells..." line if prompted.
- Run in order from top to bottom starting with the "Defining ..." cell block and ending on the "Finding the Invariants" cell block.
- The "Plotting the Invariants" cell may be run to display non-zero invariants of interest. It may be modified with its first cell.
- Additional cell blocks may exist if other free parameters (such as redshift) were investigated. They are identical in usage to the "Plotting the Invariants" cell block.
